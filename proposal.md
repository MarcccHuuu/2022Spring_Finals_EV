##### Hypothesis 1:  
Are the development trends of new energy vehicles in each state consistent, or have they changed?
##### Hypothesis 2:
What is the difference in sales between different brands of new energy vehicles？
##### Hypothesis 3:
Are sales of new energy vehicles in different states related to the number of charging piles? 
##### Hypothesis 4:
Are new energy vehicle sales related to urban GDP, population density and other factors?
