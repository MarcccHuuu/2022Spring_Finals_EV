### Research Background
With the global control of carbon emissions, more and more gasoline-fueled equipment has been replaced by clean energy, 
of which the fastest growing is the automotive field. With the development of science and technology, electric vehicles 
have gradually become people's first choice. Especially in the United States, where the electric vehicle industry is 
the most advanced, the market share of electric vehicles is getting higher and higher, but the development of electric 
vehicles varies from state to state. Therefore, this study is based on the data of electric vehicles in Washington, 
Texas and New York, which have a large number of electric vehicles, in order to find out the law of electric vehicle 
development. Through the investigation of relevant literature, we give the following hypothesis.


##### Hypothesis 1:  
Are the development trends of new energy vehicles in each state consistent, or have they changed?
##### Hypothesis 2:
What is the difference in sales between different brands of new energy vehicles in different state？
##### Hypothesis 3:
We expect there is a strong positive correlation between the number of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles sold 
compared to the number of public charging stations in the same region.
##### Hypothesis 4:
Are new energy vehicle sales related to urban GDP, population density and other factors?
