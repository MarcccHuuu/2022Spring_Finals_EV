## Hypotheses

### Hypothesis 1: 
### What is the difference in sales between different brands of new energy vehicles？
Conclusion:

Overall, Washington State has the most sales of electric cars.In terms of sales of different brands, although Tesla occupies the largest market in each state, the state with the largest sales volume is Washington State, however. The state with the largest relative market share is Texas, which shows that although the sales of electric vehicles in Washington state are good, Tesla is the most popular in Texas.

Secondly, although Tesla is the most sold in every state, the advantage in Washington state is not as obvious as the other two states, which also shows that people in Washington state will have more different preferences when choosing electric vehicles.

Of course, there are many reasons for these differences, and these reasons require further analysis.


### Hypothesis 2: 
### Development trends for different electric vehicles are inconsistent. Tesla always possesses the most progressive models in the EV market.
Conclusion:

In conclusion, we can confirm that Development trends for different electric vehicles are inconsistent. And different types of EV, different states also have different results. Tesla now is the most progressive make in the EV market of these months, however, some new brands and makes are starting to make their mark in our sights. In other words, Tesla is facing some Crises and Challenges now.

### Hypothesis 3: 
### We expect there is a strong positive correlation between the number of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles sold compared to the number of public charging stations in the same region.
Conclusion:

We perform linear regression on the variable: the number of charging piles per zip and the variable: the number of electric vehicles per zip to verify Hypothesis 3, through the straight line fitted by the linear regression, we found that the correlation coefficient is 0.34, which is a weak correlation, so we reject the hypothesis 3.

In this way, we may assume that there is no or very small relationship between EV owner’s decision and Charging Station. EV consumers purchase specific cars for other reasons. In fact, Even the Battery Electric Vehicle, energy supports them to drive for hundreds of kilometers. So in the face of technology, the reality factor has been greatly mitigated
